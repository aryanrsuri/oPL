-- Test variable shadowing prevention

-- This should work (initial definition)
let x = 10;
println("Initial value of x");

-- This should cause an error (redefining in same scope)
let x = 20;
println("This line shouldn't be reached if shadowing is prevented");

-- This should still work (different variable)
let y = 30;
println("Value of y: ");
